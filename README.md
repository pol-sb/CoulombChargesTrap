## About <a name = "about"></a>
This repository contains a script which performs simulations of Coulomb clusters confined in a harmonic potential.

These simulations lead to simple, "polyhedral" structures if the system
is cooled to low enough temperatures.

The program aims to help visualize these structures by finding the potential
energy minimum of the system and its geometry by using the Monte Carlo
method.

The code is VERY unoptimized as of now, but it will be improved in the future.


## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The script works with python versions > 3.6, mainly because it uses f-strings for returning some results.

Additionally, the script uses several python modules. These modules are
listed on the 'requirements.txt' file, and can be installed by running:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
while the requirements.txt file is located in the cwd.

### Running

Running the script is simple.
After cloning the repository, the script "run_simulation.py" should be executed with:

```
python3 run_simulation.py
```
The program will run the simulation and save the results in a new folder named 'iontrap_TIMESTAMP'.


## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
As of now, the script 'run_simulation.py' must be changed manually to 
modify any parameters of the system.

An argument parser may be included in the future, but for now, the values
of the dictionary "ar_dict" inside the run_simulation script must be changed
manually.

Here is a quick overview of the parameters:

- N_list: List of different number of particles. This will make the script run various simulations for the given N. Each N must be an integer.
- L: Lattice size (float)
- q: Ionic charge (float)
- m: Mass (float)
- alpha: Symmetry of the external harmonic potential. Alpha = 1 for spherical
symmetry and alpha != 1 for cylindrical symmetry.
- omega: Natural frequency

The file "mc_utils.py" contains the main functions necessary for the simulation
and it is intended to be used as a module file for the run_simulation.py script.
